This is JB SvelteKit Starter, a project by [Jesse Benjamin](https://jessebenjamin.me) designed to get you up and running with SvelteKit for static websites and blogs.

I started this project because I love Svelte, want to see more people use it, and felt there was a lack of good reference for a blog with support for search & image optimisation all in the one place.
